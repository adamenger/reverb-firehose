# Reverb Firehose
This app is meant to display an easy to look at view of the last 10 listings on Reverb.com

### Getting started

The easiest way to view the firehose is by opening up in a browser on your workstation, like so:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:adamenger/reverb-firehose.git
$ cd reverb-firehose
$ open index.html
```

You can get more complicated and host it somewhere but that's out of the scope of this document.

Have fun!
